# Dotfiles

An opinionated set of dotfiles based `zsh` and [homebrew](https://brew.sh). Much of the setup is based on Mark H Nichols's clean [Zsh Configuration from the ground up](https://zanshin.net/2013/02/02/zsh-configuration-from-the-ground-up/).

## Installing

Clone this repo to `$HOME/dotfiles` and run `install.sh`. It'll set `osx` defaults, install the `homebrew` casks and libraries in the `Brewfile`, and set up `zsh`.
